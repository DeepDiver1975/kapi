# Kopano API pubs plugin

The pubs plugin provides a simple pub/sub system with HTTP webhooks and websocket
stream subscription.

## Configuration

For security, the pubs plugin needs a secret key so it can HMAC its tokens. By
default a random 512 bit secret key is generated on startup. For production use
the key should not change and can be provided as hex encoded value by the
`KOPANO_PUBS_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. A suitable key value can be
created with with `openssl rand -hex 64`.

`KOPANO_PUBS_ALLOW_CORS` is an environment variable which if set to `1`
enables CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) HTTP requests and headers so that
the REST endpoints provided by this plugin can be used from a browser cross
origin.

`KOPANO_PUBS_REQUIRED_SCOPES` is an environment variable which defines the
required access token scopes to grant access to the API endpoints provided by
this plugin. By default the scopes are `kopano/pubs`.

## HTTP API v1

The base URL to this API is `/api/pubs/v1`. All example URLs are sub paths of
this base URL.

### Authentication

All endpoints of the Pubs API require [OAuth2 Bearer authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1) with an access
token (if not stated otherwise).

### Register webhook pub URL

Registers a new webhook URL to publish data to a certain topic.

```
POST /webhook?topic=optional-client-provided-topic
201
```
```
{
	"id": "${id}",
	"pubUrl": "/api/pubs/v1/webhook/${topic-and-webhook-token-id}",
	"topic": "${topic-as-passed-to-post-or-random}"
}
```

The `id` is auto generated by the server and is unique and can be used to
reference this webhook. If no topic is provided via the `topic` request
parameter, a unique secure random topic is generated and returned.

### Webhook pub

Publish data to a previously registered webhook URL. Authorization and topic are
encoded inside the token and cannot be changed. Thus the webhook pub endpoints
do not require additional Bearer authentication.

```
POST /webhook/${id}/${topic-and-webhook-token}
POST /webhook/${id}/${topic-and-webhook-token}/${envelope}
204
```

Optionally the data is enclosed into a JSON structure with a type matching the
value of the subpath `envelope`.

### Websocket bi-directional event stream

Websocket stream can be used to interact with pubs pub/sub. To retrieve the
address for Websocket streaming, issue an authenticated request to the
`/stream/connect` endpoint.

```
GET /stream/connect
200
```
```
{
  "streamUrl": "/api/pubs/v1/stream/websocket/ap1L3rNzuC9uWc07FT3QJCDZ1Q8PjLoV"
}
```

The `streamUrl` is a one URL to use for Websocket streaming. It can be used
exactly one time. Further connects will result in 404. If the connection is
lost, call connect again. The Websocket stream URL does not require Bearer
authentication.

```
GET /stream/${key} (Websocket)
101
```

The `key` is part of the URL received from a previous call to `/stream/connect`.

#### Websocket payload data

```
< {
  "type": "hello",
  "info": {
    "ref": "gnP4kvAKhHAd4ZalVDsRVmkvi9nHHYF71vsCz0UcX2k="
  }
}
```

```
> {
	"type": "sub"
	"state": "optional-client-controlled-state",
	"data": {
		"topics": ["topic1", "topic2"]
	}
}
< {
  "type": "ack",
  "state": "optional-client-controlled-state"
}
```

```
< {
  "type": "event",
  "data": {
    "type": "trigger-controlled-envelope",
    "data": 1
  },
  "info": {
    "ref": "HINSF2ZYw4MIJCVW4EdorffqTAW4tGJEMifd4lsIcy8=",
    "topics": [
      "topic1"
    ]
  }
}
```

Possible types are `hello`, `ack`, `sub`, `unsub`, `closeTopic`, `pub` and
`event`.

If the payload data contains a `state` value, then the server replies
with an `ack` type once the action has been exectued. The `ack` payload includes
the state unmodified.

All received `event` messages, contain an `info` object, with the `ref` to the
sending entity (if any) and the `topics` array which tells what topics this
message was meant for.

The `data` value of the `event` type is entirely controlled by the trigger, and
thus is application specific. For simplicity in client implementations it is
recommended to always use a JSON object for `data` together with a `type` key
so applications can easily handle incoming messages.

### Usage examples

This assumes you have [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) and [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) in your path.

Websocket example:

```
$ export PUBS_HOST=https://localhost:8428"
$ wscat -n --connect $PUBS_HOST/api/pubs/v1/stream/websocket
connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
< {
  "type": "hello",
  "info": {
    "ref": "qIclxqTjWWh3KkPYwrZaO1uDIjxbSsIGdHscLpWkLg4="
  }
}
> {"type": "sub", "state": "123", "info": {"topics": ["lala"]}}
< {
  "type": "ack",
  "state": "123"
}
```

Webhook example:

```
$ export TOKEN_VALUE=<access_token>
$ curl -s -XPOST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_VALUE" "$PUBS_HOST/api/pubs/v1/webhook?topic=lala"
{
  "id": "VNEH1P5s6v1mTKGcG4pwKp9GNxp-bqx2r2oB52uCkfM=",
  "topic": "lala",
  "pubUrl": "/api/pubs/v1/webhook/VNEH1P5s6v1mTKGcG4pwKp9GNxp-bqx2r2oB52uCkfM=/MTUxODUyMjc5NnxNdi1CQXdFQkUzZGxZbWh2YjJ0UWRXSlViMnRsYmtSaGRHRUJfNElBQVFJQkFrbEVBUXdBQVFWVWIzQnBZd0VNQUFBQU5fLUNBU3hXVGtWSU1WQTFjeloyTVcxVVMwZGpSelJ3ZDB0d09VZE9lSEF0WW5GNE1uSXliMEkxTW5WRGEyWk5QUUVFYkdGc1lRQT18U84T7M7v3wD5xuO7P4O5WzICbLAUwuxvPDX2Rjpz_Ic="
